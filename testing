Testing is crucial in web development, but it can get confusing with all the terms. Let's break it down simply:

Unit Tests: These check small parts of code, like functions, to make sure they work as expected. They're fast and easy to write.
For example, if we have a function that adds two numbers together, a unit test would pass different sets of numbers into the function and check if the result is as expected.

Integration Tests: These test how different parts of the code work together. They're a bit harder to write and take longer to run.
For instance, if we have a login system where users enter their username and password, an integration test would check if the login process works smoothly from entering credentials to accessing the main dashboard.

End-to-End Tests: These test everything in the system, like the login process, APIs, and how the app looks. They're super important but can be tough to set up and run.
For example, an end-to-end test for an e-commerce website would involve simulating a user browsing products, adding items to the cart, completing the checkout process, and verifying that the order is successfully placed.

It's all about balance. We want tests that give us confidence without slowing us down. Sometimes, one good integration test can be as helpful as lots of unit tests.

Remember, the goal is to make sure our code works well and we can change it without breaking anything important. So, choose the tests that help you do that best.
